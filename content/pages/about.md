<p style="text-align:justify">I graduated from New York University 16' with a B.A. in Individualized Studies. 
At NYU Gallatin I successfully defended my colloquium on <i>The Evolution of Mind and Consciousness</i> 
to my academic advisors and panel members Dr. Peder Anker, Dr. Matthew Stanley and Dr. Rahul Hamid.
At UF College of Medicine, I worked in the Kasahara Lab on understand the function of Nkx2.5 in the 
Department of Physiology and Genomics.</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify">When I learned about the Data Science program Lambda School
was offering were enrolling students. I decided to take a risk and enroll full-time. Data Science
is an opportunity combining an interdisciplinary skill set to effect a positive change in the world.
Currently, my favorite topics include natural language processing, object detection and 
effective data visualization. Occasionally, I publish articles on <a href="https://medium.com/@andronikmk">Medium</a> but in the future
I will be publishing exclusively to the <i>Articles</i> section page.</p>

<p>My hobbies outside of Data Science include reading, personal fitness, nutrition, and <i>Criterion Collection</i>.
I enjoy reading about the history of philosophy, epistemology and philosophy of mind. My two favorite books are
<i>A History of Civilizations</i> by Fernand Braudel and <i>I Am a Strange Loop</i> by Douglas Hofstadter.
In addition, I like to play tennis and go to the gym to stay active. The last great movie I watched was
<l>The Seventh Seal</l> by Ingmar Bergman.</p>

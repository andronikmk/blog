## Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
TwitOff is a fun and interactive application that allows you to predict which user is more likely
to post a particular tweet from their account. Build using Flask, the script pulls data from 
the Twitter Developer API and populates a SQLite datebase. Afterward, the user inputs a string into
a prompt and a logistic regression is run on our data with accuracy used as our metric. Finally,
to make our application stand out a <a href="https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css/">NES.css</a> template is used
and the application is deploted to Heroku.

## Model and Metric
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
TwitOff uses a Logistic Regression algorithm to predict the probabilty
of a given tweet with a 72.1% accuracy score. For more information on
Logistic Regression and how it works please read <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d7bb/66bf9cc78ace5ce49bf2204c85973ef1fa41.pdf">Retweet Predictive Model in Twitter</a>

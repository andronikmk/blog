## Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
TwitOff is a fun and interactive application that allows you to predict which user is more likely
to post a particular tweet from their account. Build using Flask, the script pulls data from 
the Twitter Developer API and populates a SQLite datebase. Afterward, the user inputs a string into
a prompt and a logistic regression is run on our data with accuracy used as our metric. Finally,
to make our application stand out a <a href="https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css/">NES.css</a> template is used
and the application is deploted to Heroku.
